Walk in the shadowland, nobody's innocent
Hand to mouth, we lived like demons
Stuck in the phantom zone, lost in a thunder dome
Twilight ruled the day
We found the imposible, now we're ubstopable
Taking off, the world beneath us
Strong under pressure, we'll make it together
Our unoverse will change
Fredome looking down a telescope
Starlight never been so beautiful
Whole world waiting for us, time to go
Escaping gravity
We'll ricing hight above the rain
Sunset never gonna be the same
Thunder calling us to outher space
Escaping gravity
Escaping gravity
Escaping gravity
Starlight dances in the silver of the night sky
Way above the clouds, we will be sailing high
Sailing high, sailing high, ooh
You and me, we're gonna touch the stars
Find the center of the universe
New reality in front of us
Escaping gravity
We'll rising hight above the rain 
Sunset never gonna be the same
Thunder calling us to outher space
Escaping gravity
Escaping gravity
Escaping gravity
