Walk in the shadowland, nobody's innocent
Hand to mouth, we lived like demons
Stuck in the phantom zone, lost in a thunder dome
Twilight ruled the day
We found the imposible, now we're ubstopable
Taking off, the world beneath us
Strong under pressure, we'll make it together
Our unoverse will change
Fredome looking down a telescope
Starlight never been so beautiful
Whole world waiting for us, time to go
Escaping gravity
We'll ricing hight above the rain
Sunset never gonna be the same
Thunder calling us to outher space
Escaping gravity
Escaping gravity
